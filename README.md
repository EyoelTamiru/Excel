Cybersecurity Threats Dataset (2015-2024) README 
Overview 
This dataset provides a comprehensive record of cybersecurity incidents across various 
countries, industries, and years, spanning from 2015 to 2024. It includes details about attack 
types, financial losses, affected users, sources of attacks, vulnerabilities exploited, defense 
mechanisms employed, and resolution times. The data is intended for analysis of global 
cybersecurity trends, vulnerabilities, and the effectiveness of defense strategies. 
Dataset Description 
The dataset contains 307 detailed records of cybersecurity incidents, with additional summary 
tables providing aggregated counts and totals. It captures incidents across multiple dimensions, 
including: 
Geographical Scope: Countries such as China, India, UK, USA, Germany, France, Japan, Brazil, 
Russia, and Australia. - Time Period: Yearly data from 2015 to 2024. -Industries Targeted: Banking, Education, Government, Healthcare, IT, Retail, and 
Telecommunications. - Attack Types: Phishing, Ransomware, DDoS, SQL Injection, Man-in-the-Middle, Malware, etc. - Impact Metrics: Financial losses (in millions of USD) and the number of affected users. - Attack Sources: Hacker Groups, Nation-states, Insiders, and Unknown entities. - Vulnerabilities: Unpatched Software, Weak Passwords, Social Engineering, Zero-day exploits. - Defense Mechanisms: VPN, Firewall, Antivirus, Encryption, AI-based Detection. 
The dataset also includes summary tables, such as counts of incidents by country and defense 
mechanism effectiveness, as well as totals of affected users by vulnerability type over the years. 
File Structure - Main Data Table: A detailed list of 307 cybersecurity incidents with 10 primary columns. - Summary Tables - Count of incidents by industry and effectiveness (Effective, Ineffective, Partially Effective). 
- Count of incidents by attack type and defense mechanism. - Sum of affected users by vulnerability type and year (2015‚Äì2024). - Additional Metadata: Includes a title ("Global Cybersecurity Threats (2015-2024)") and some 
truncated or incomplete sections (e.g., "Unnamed" columns). 
Usage Notes 
1. Data Cleaning: - Some columns (e.g., "Unnamed: 2", "Unnamed: 3") appear incomplete or truncated. These 
may require removal or further investigation. - The dataset includes both detailed records and summary tables, which may need to be 
separated for specific analyses. 
2. Analysis Opportunities: - Trend analysis: Examine how attack types and vulnerabilities evolve over time (2015‚Äì2024). - Geographical insights: Compare cybersecurity threats across countries or regions. - Industry impact: Assess which sectors (e.g., Healthcare, Banking) are most vulnerable. - Defense effectiveness: Evaluate the success rates of different defense mechanisms. 
3. Limitations: - The dataset does not specify the source of the data or its collection methodology. - Some records may be incomplete due to truncation (e.g., "UK 2022 Phishing 
Government..."). - Financial losses and user counts are approximate and may not account for unreported 
incidents.
